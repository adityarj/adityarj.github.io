                <h2>iLight 2017</h2>
                <p>iLight 2017 was extremely popular with the youth of Singapore. Open for a month from 3rd to 26th March at Marina Bayfront, it was thronged by youngsters looking for a chance to escape the monotone of their lives and experience a plethora of colors. Many took to instagram to show their creative side with photos. Thus, we were extremely interested if we could capture this phenomenon.

                    As such, our question was: <br><br><b>“Can we see trends for iLight 2017 through Instagram?”</b>
                </p>
                <h2>Curating the Data</h2>
                <p>Our data came from public accounts in Instagram. Instragram does not provide an official API for us to use, thus we used a <a href="https://github.com/huttarichard/instagram-private-api">nodejs wrapper</a> to simulate a phone making internal API requests to instagram to collect photos with the tag #iLight. The pictures from the data were downloaded and the corresponding pictures data was put into csv format for further classification.</p>

                <h2>Getting the Data</h2>
                <p>Our data came from public accounts in Instagram. As we had restrictions (explained below), we used a combination of node.js and Instagram API to scrape photos tagged #iLight. Next, comments and date of post was scrapped using javascript and downloaded as a CSV file.</p>

                <h2>Cleaning and Classifying Data</h2>
                <p>The original CSV file was badly formatted and such was cleaned using R before being reexported. The dates were in time since epoch and thus had to be converted to date format.
                    Thee photographs were manually sorted according to number of people, time of day and the exhibit based on the iLight festival map.
                </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" style="color: black">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <h2>What were the most popular exhibits? </h2>
            <p>There were a total of 21 exhibits for iLight, and we first wanted to find which ones were the most popular to take photos with.
                After manually sorting the data based on the iLight Festival Map, we simply needed to collate the data. We used a bubble chart to
                get a quick reference</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div  id="exhibitBreakdown" class="col-lg-12">

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <p>Horizontal interference is the clear winner, however, notice the large bubble of photos taken at the Marina.
                These are photos taken of the Marina, or around raffles and not of the exhibit itself.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <h2>What kind of photos did people take (Composition)?</h2>
                <p>Do people tend to take photos of themselves or the exhibit when they visit? This was the next question we focused on,
                    our groups of study would be:
                </p>
                <div>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Group</li>
                    <li>Single Male</li>
                    <li>Single Female</li>
                    <li>Couple</li>
                    <li>None</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                Single Male and Female do not refer to the poser's relationship status, but rather the number of people in the picture.
                After manually sorting the data, we used a treemap based on the proportion of photos, along with a further metric of when the
                photo was taken.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12" id="compositionBreakdown"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <p>Surprisingly, most of the photos were taken without anyone in the frame! You'll also notice that there were quite a few photos taken during the time.
                While some of these were from iLight, a majority were around the Marina Bay itself.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <h2>What kind of photos did people take (Average color)?</h2>
                <p>The next thing we wanted to understand was what kind of color did people have in their photos.
                    This helps in understanding what sort of feel people get from an event like iLight, and what reflects in their photos.
                    We first found the average color of each photo and then sorted the photos by the Hue value in the HSL color range.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <p>Unsurprisingly, much of the photos or nearly 60%, had an average hue of blue or purple. These breakpoints were calculated manually.
                While, the majority of the iLight exhibits did not have blue or purple in their artwork. The popular ones, like Horizontal Interference and Ocean Pavillion did.
                Other than this, another reason is Gastrobeats, whose signboard was purple and quite a number of photos.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <h2>Why were some exhibits more popular than others?</h2>
            <p>Trying to explain the popularity of an exhibit is quite hard, because it is a qualititative measure rather than a quantitative one. Rather, we looked to see if there were specific reasons as to why some exhibits might be less or more popular than others. One perculiar thing we noticed was that some exhibits were only open on weekends, while others were open throughout the week. This could reduce the chances of people experiencing that exhibit which would lead to less photos for it. To see if photos of these exhibits (artbox, artzoo) were indeed only posted on weekends, we plot an interactive faceted graph based on day and exhibit.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hover over the histogram and the piechart to see visualisations for the specific day/exhibit.

            <h2>What kind of words do people use to describe iLight?</h2>
            <p>
                Words give meaning and context where mere pictures cannot. They give us an insight to how the author of the picture was feeling when he/she posted the photo. As such it is a pretty accurate description of how iLight was received as a whole. We parsed through the captions of all the photos and came up with the most frequently used words that were used to describe iLight.
